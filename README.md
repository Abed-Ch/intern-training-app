# Intern Full-Stack Training App

Welcome! This is your full-stack training project. You’ll learn how to build a small web app from scratch using real tools like:

- **React** for the frontend (what the user sees)
- **Node.js + Express** for the backend (the server that responds to requests)
- **SQLite** for the database (where we store quotes)

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `frontend/` → your React app
- `backend/` → your Express server and SQLite database

## 🚦 How to Get Started

1. Clone this repo to your laptop
2. Open the project in **VS Code**
3. Start with the **frontend or backend**, depending on the Jira story assigned to you
4. Follow the instructions in each folder’s README
5. Use the **Git icon in VS Code** to create branches, commit, and push

Ask your mentor if you get stuck.

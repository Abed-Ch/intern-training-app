# Frontend – React App

This folder is where you’ll build the user interface using **React** and **TypeScript**.

## 💻 What You Will Build

- A page that shows quotes
- A button to see a new quote
- Real quotes loaded from your backend API

## 🛠️ How to Start

1. Open the `frontend` folder in VS Code
2. Open the terminal (View → Terminal)
3. Run this:

   npm create vite@latest

   - Name: frontend
   - Framework: React
   - Variant: TypeScript

4. Then run:

   cd frontend  
   npm install  
   npm run dev

5. A browser window should open — that’s your app.

## 🌱 Copilot Tip

Ask:  
**“Make a React component that shows a quote and has a button to show the next one.”**

Then try to understand what the code is doing.
